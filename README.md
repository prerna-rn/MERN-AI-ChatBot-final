note to self
for integrating this ts chatbot in js project
1. where is this folder in my pc?
2. start working in the final js app git commands
3. https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/ run npm install --save typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest in terminal 
4. put chatbot's frontend and backend in the respective folders of existing js app.
5. routes.
6. remove the login page it doesn't look good when app already has login page.
